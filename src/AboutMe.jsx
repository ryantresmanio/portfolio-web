            Hi, I'm Ryan â€” but most people call me Tres. I'm an aspiring developer with a background in Java and Spring Boot. I recently finished my degree in Computer Science and have been continuing to learn and explore different areas of the tech industry. I enjoy working on simple, user-friendly projects and improving little by little.
            <br /><br />
            Outside of coding, I love singing, recording covers, and browsing TikTok in my free time.
